<p>A story about tornadoes and cows, wrapped in a love story. <br/>
    There's a reason you have to pay to rent this movie almost <strong>30 years</strong> after its debut.

<p>There's no arguement to be made here. Don't even try. <br/>
        Nothing captures the childhood of a 90's baby like <em>The Lion King.</em>

<h3>Halloweentown</h3>
